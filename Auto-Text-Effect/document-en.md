1. Two variables, **`textEl`** and **`speedEl`**, are defined to reference relevant elements in the HTML document. **`textEl`** is used to display text, and **`speedEl`** is used to adjust the typing speed.
2. A text variable named **`text`** is defined, representing the text to be typed.
3. Two more variables, **`idx`** and **`speed`**, are declared. **`idx`** is used to track the progress of typing, and **`speed`** represents the typing speed. The **`speed`** variable initially starts with a value of **`300 / speedEl.value`**, and it gets updated when the user changes the typing speed.
4. A function named **`writeText`** is defined. This function is used to type the text step by step. The relevant portion of the text is written to the **`textEl`** element using **`text.slice(0, idx)`**. Then, **`idx`** is incremented, and when the end of the text is reached, **`idx`** is reset to 1. The **`setTimeout`** function is used to periodically call the **`writeText`** function at the specified typing speed (**`speed`**).
5. An "input" event listener is added to the **`speedEl`** element. When the user changes the typing speed, this listener is triggered, and it updates the **`speed`** variable. This allows the typing speed to be dynamically adjusted
