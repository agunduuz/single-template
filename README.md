# Single Templates

### Hello friends 👋 <br>
This folder contains projects serving a **single purpose**. Button actions, Slider operations, Navbar, etc. <br>
Each project I have created will be uploaded quickly 🚀 These projects, which I have implemented for **practical purposes**, will be useful for my work when the time comes.
I hope you can benefit from them as well. <br> <br>
The fundamental tools used in the projects are for a Basic Front-End Developer: 
- **HTML 🌐**
- **CSS 🎨**
- **JavaScript 💻**

May you have a practical and joyful life. 😊

**_NOTE:_** In my projects, **I used the Turkish language**. Within each project, I have provided a description of the subject matter. 
There is a file where **I explain the process step by step**. <br>

If you would like to review them, you can find the links to the project files below. 😊📂
